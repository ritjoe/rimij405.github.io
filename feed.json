No; this is about making PowerShell better with a Scoop.</p>\n<h2 id=\"What-is-this-software\"><a href=\"#What-is-this-software\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"What is this software?\"></a>What is this software?</h2><p><a href=\"https://scoop.sh/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Scoop</a> is a command-line installer for Windows that was made to help make PowerShell a bit more <em>digestible</em>. Appreciating scoop requires a decent understanding of the context behind PowerShell and the Windows security system in general.</p>\n<h3 id=\"PowerShell-Problems\"><a href=\"#PowerShell-Problems\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"PowerShell Problems\"></a>PowerShell Problems</h3><p>Microsoft, created PowerShell with cmdlets (<code>command-lets</code>) - lightweight scripts that perform a single function - and created a Verb-Noun naming convention to help reduce <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/learn/learning-powershell-names?view=powershell-6\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">command memorization</a>. This is quite neat if you’re just getting started with terminals, shells, and Windows’ awkward brand of system administration - genuinely, I am a big fan of making things more accessible for new users.</p>\n<p>Nothing’s clearer than a command that says, <code>Stop-Service</code>, and it doesn’t take a senior SysAdmin to understand what a <code>Get</code> Verb command might do to a Noun - good things I’m sure! However, the trade off tends to work against developers who <strong>do</strong> begin to memorize the more frequently used commands. </p>\n<p>PowerShell’s are quite literally <em>verbose</em>. While some commands have aliases they aren’t necessarily the most familiar. <code>Get-ChildItem</code> is <a href=\"https://www.pdq.com/powershell/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">listed as the command that</a>, “gets the items and child items in one or more specified locations.” It’s aliases? <code>dir</code>, <code>gci</code>, and <code>ls</code>.</p>\n<p>Most other commands, however, might be clear and transparent in meaning - but they lack any reasonable alias. No Unix developer is going to spend time configuring their aliases in Windows PowerShell when they can simply boot up <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Linux Bash on Windows</a>.</p>\n<p>Scoop helps by providing familiar tools from the bash environment and making them available to PowerShell. For example, <code>scoop install curl</code> will allow you to use the <code>curl</code> tool on PowerShell under your user account. </p>\n<p>What does vanilla PowerShell do? <a href=\"https://superuser.com/questions/344927/powershell-equivalent-of-curl#comment995042_591311\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">It has aliased</a> the <code>Invoke-RestMethod</code> cmdlet as <code>curl</code> and <code>wget</code> while utilizing an entirely different syntax.</p>\n<p>Don’t want to use the cmdlet? The related PowerShell commands aren’t much better:<br><code>(New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString(&quot;http://www.example.com/hello-world.html&quot;,&quot;C:\\hello-world.html&quot;)</code>.</p>\n<p>Speaking of which…</p>\n<h3 id=\"Windows-Security\"><a href=\"#Windows-Security\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Windows Security\"></a>Windows Security</h3><p>Want to install something in Windows? I hope your pointer finger is ready.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/posts/scoop/uac.jpg\" alt=\"Image of a User Access Control dialogue box on a Windows system.\"><br><em>When I’m not on the internet, I don’t expect pop-ups.</em></p>\n<p>Introduced with Windows Vista, the User Account Control (UAC) is a part of Windows’ authentication and security suite. In the great scheme of things, this is the force behind the dialogue boxes that will interrupt your mojo whenever you try to make sure your installer isn’t employing any <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_pattern\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">dark patterns</a>.</p>\n<p>There is no way to turn off UAC’s pop-up functionality on Windows. Scoop, however, is not like PowerShell and it certainly is not like Windows. It doesn’t concern itself with things that it doesn’t need to care about.</p>\n<p>See, scoop understands something that all good Unix developers understand: you don’t need to sudo to install every little thing on your system.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://github.com/lukesampson/scoop/tree/master/bucket\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">collections</a> of <a href=\"https://github.com/lukesampson/scoop-extras\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">programs</a> that scoop provides an easy installation for are filled with examples where this is true. </p>\n<p>I do not and I <strong>should not</strong> be giving administrative access and permissions to installers for most programs. Most applications don’t need to be installed to the <code>C:Program Files</code> directories - there are many that can operate in a standalone (even portable) capacity.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Why-get-this\"><a href=\"#Why-get-this\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Why get this?\"></a>Why get this?</h2><p>Besides bettering your life, scoop is also a scriptable framework. It’s encouraged if you’re looking for a way to consistently setup environments on Windows systems that have access to PowerShell.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Who-created-this\"><a href=\"#Who-created-this\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Who created this?\"></a>Who created this?</h2><p>The original creator <a href=\"https://github.com/lukesampson\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">@lukesampson</a> hasn’t submitted a new commit since mid-2017.

This is a specific way to for developers to dedicate work to the public domain. The license itself combines a copyright waiver similar to that from the public domain SQLite project with the no-warranty statement from the MIT/X11 license.</p>\n<p>It’s the antithesis to ‘all rights reserved’ - this license is a bit of a ‘<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">no rights reserved</a>‘ situation.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Can-I-contribute\"><a href=\"#Can-I-contribute\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Can I contribute?\"></a>Can I contribute?</h2><p>Since the time of writing, the last pull request was created 8 hours ago; it’s very active. In fact, the one disadvantage is that it’s become a burden on the current community.</p>\n<p>GitHub contributor <a href=\"https://github.com/h404bi\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">@h404bi</a> submitted an <a href=\"https://github.com/lukesampson/scoop/issues/2939\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">issue</a> last New Year’s Eve asking for the community to consider the fact that Scoop never releases a version that is ‘explicitly’ stable. The other developers agreed.</p>\n<p>As it stands, they have yet to finalize a new workflow but their main challenge is separating the buckets - the name given to collections holding program installation settings and metadata - from the core of the program. </p>\n<p>It’s a relatively small codebase and the documentation is more than enough for someone interested in getting started with how it works.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Caveats-about-PowerShell\"><a href=\"#Caveats-about-PowerShell\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Caveats about PowerShell\"></a>Caveats about PowerShell</h2><p>It is silly to realistically expect PowerShell to work like Bash. Even if the Verb-Noun dynamic gets tiresome, PowerShell is far from the only option available to users on Windows systems and people are always encouraged to use what they know best.</p>\n<p>PowerShell is open-source; and so is scoop. These are both examples of what community development can support. The best part is the freedom to modify your environment however you see fit…</p>\n<hr>\n<p>…That is, until you remember that Windows 10 is still a proprietary operating system and that nice OpenSUSE distro I have running a KDE Plasma desktop environment is sweet, sweet FLOSS.</p>\n<p>After all things considered, perhaps it is with a bit of irony that in order to get scoop on Windows, you’ll need to be prepared to install it using plain old PowerShell.</p>\n<p><code>iex (new-object net.webclient).downloadstring(&#39;https://get.scoop.sh&#39;)</code></p>\n<p>(And you might come across a UAC error when you try this too).</p>\n","date_published":"2019-04-03T05:18:07.000Z","date_modified":"2019-04-03T05:18:18.981Z","author":{"name":"Ian Effendi","url":"http://rimij405.github.io"},"tags":"blog,hfoss"},{"id":"http://rimij405.github.io/blog/hfoss/finalteam/","url":"http://rimij405.github.io/blog/hfoss/finalteam/","external_url":"","title":"Sugarlabs Activity: Team Proposal","link":"http://rimij405.github.io/blog/hfoss/finalteam/","summary":"","content_html":"<h1 id=\"Sugarlabs-Activity-Team-Proposal\"><a href=\"#Sugarlabs-Activity-Team-Proposal\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Sugarlabs Activity - Team Proposal\"></a>Sugarlabs Activity - Team Proposal</h1><p>This blog post serves as a proposal for the creation of an educational <em>activity</em> on the Sugar Desktop Environment.

Learners are tasked with practicing their mathematical foundations for fractional arithmetic operations, like whole number division and multiplication. We plan on using PyGame to power our activity. <a href=\"https://www.pygame.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">PyGame</a> is a game engine written in <a href=\"https://www.python.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Python</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">C</a>), released under the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Lesser_General_Public_License\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">LGPL</a> license.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Scenario-1\"><a href=\"#Scenario-1\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Scenario 1\"></a>Scenario 1</h3><p>In the first section, learners must weigh suitcases at baggage claim to make sure that they aren’t over the safety limit. Suitcases are given a ‘fraction’ as a weight and they must decide whether it is equal, over, or under the safety limit - which will also be given a ‘fraction’ as a value.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Scenario-2\"><a href=\"#Scenario-2\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Scenario 2\"></a>Scenario 2</h3><p>In the second section, learners are encouraged to slice pizza using the exact angles customers order. Learners can use their pointer device to select the exact lines and angles that they need, mimicing the experience of using a protractor digitally.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Stretch-Goal\"><a href=\"#Stretch-Goal\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Stretch Goal\"></a>Stretch Goal</h3><p>Tying these elements together is a score system that learners can cash in at an in-activity, fictional storefront, where they can redeem points for unlockables. This third portion of the idea needs to be fleshed out - however, it serves as a thematic force that pulls it all together. Learnes who do best with extrinsic forms of motivation may find themselves revisiting the scenarios in order to do better. By keeping each slice of gameplay short, episodic, and replayable, we invite learners to revisit the work that they’ve done.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Educational-Goals\"><a href=\"#Educational-Goals\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Educational Goals\"></a>Educational Goals</h2><p>Our team will create a Sugar activity that targets users who are learning or reviewing 4th-grade level appropriate mathematics. The Sugar platform was born out of the international <a href=\"http://one.laptop.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">One-Laptop-Per-Child</a> project and every country’s pedagogy and curriculum is different. For the sake of this project, we’ve examined some of the standards used in the United States’ K-12 grade school system.</p>\n<h3 id=\"4th-Grade-Level-Mathematics\"><a href=\"#4th-Grade-Level-Mathematics\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"4th Grade Level Mathematics\"></a>4th Grade Level Mathematics</h3><p>According to the <a href=\"http://www.corestandards.org/Math/Content/4/introduction/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Common Core State Standards Initiative</a>, instructional time on mathematics for 4th grade students focuses on <em>three</em> <strong><em>critical areas</em></strong>:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Developing understanding and fluency with <strong>multi-digit multiplication</strong>, and developing understanding of dividing to find quotients involving <strong>multi-digit dividends</strong>;</li>\n<li>Developing an understanding of <strong>fractional equivalence</strong>, <strong>addition</strong>, and <strong>subtraction</strong> of fractions with like denominators, and <strong>multiplication of fractions</strong> by whole numbers;</li>\n<li>Understanding that geometric figures can be <strong>analyzed</strong> and <strong>classified</strong> based on their properties, such as having <strong>parallel sides</strong>, <strong>perpendicular sides</strong>, <strong>particular angle measures</strong>, and <strong>symmetry</strong>.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>For a time, the Math4Team maintained a <a href=\"https://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Math4Team/Resources/Curriculum_Chart\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">curriculum chart</a> for 4th Grade mathematics on the Sugar Labs wiki. Based off of the <a href=\"http://www.doe.mass.edu/frameworks/current.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Massachusetts Curriculum Framework for Mathematics</a>, there came to be a working list of standards and an accounting of Sugar activities that satisfied the implied learning goals.

As said on their homepage, “OSS Watch provides unbiased advice and guidance on the use, development, and licensing of <strong>free software</strong>, <strong>open source software</strong>, and <strong>open source hardware</strong>.” [<em>emphasis theirs</em>] In partnership with <a href=\"http://pipka.org/standard-bio/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Pia Andrews</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/piawaugh\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">@piawaugh</a>, the Openness Rating tool is a diagnostic model that evaluates how ‘free and open’ a particular piece of software is.</p>\n<p>To perform an assessment, the tool asks questions as it pertains to the software’s legal issues, data formats and standards, available knowledge, project governance, and the market climate. These questions are based off of the paper <em><a href=\"http://pipka.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/Foundations-of-openness-V2-release.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Foundations of Openness</a></em>, written by Pia Andrews (publishing as Pia Waugh) and Randy Metcalfe, and are used by OSS Watch as part of their own consultancy work. Each question asked has a predefined set of answers - once all of the questions are selected, the tool is able to provide the ‘openness rating’ that serves as a benchmark for how free and open the software is.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/posts/commarchreport/osswatch_logo.png\" alt=\"OSS Watch Logo\"></p>\n<h4 id=\"Strengths\"><a href=\"#Strengths\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Strengths\"></a>Strengths</h4><p>The ‘openness rating’ tool is great for establishing a quantitative measure of how ‘FLOSS’ a software really is. This can be useful for those interested in starting a new open-source project — if they have an existing community project in mind, performing an analysis on that project can allow the new team to make educated choices regarding their work. The tool’s breakdown into separate categories also makes it relatively easy to look at the ‘openness’ of a particular area of the project — I might not particularly care about the governance for an open-source library if I’m not a contributor, so, I can focus my analysis on the legal ‘openness’ instead, as an example.</p>\n<h4 id=\"Criticisms\"><a href=\"#Criticisms\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Criticisms\"></a>Criticisms</h4><p>This tool is not well-suited for people who have never engaged with open source software before; while attempting to answer each question, it required a noticeable amount of overhead time spent researching things like ‘patent laws’. In other words, this isn’t a tool for beginners and, in most cases, might be overkill for someone looking for a simple answer in terms of how ‘open’ a software is. Although it is based off the model defined in <em>Foundations of Openness</em>, if you’re looking for a neat, clean little score, you won’t necessarily find it here. For projects with poor documentation, many of the answers can become subjective - ‘don’t know’ isn’t as much of a marker of a project’s openness than the analyst’s ignorance of the entire project’s scope. This makes it difficult when you’re trying to corroborate data format and standards across the relevant governing bodies without knowing where to begin.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/posts/commarchreport/abstract-no-connection.png\" alt=\"Abstract image representing missed connections.\"></p>\n<h3 id=\"Results\"><a href=\"#Results\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Results\"></a>Results</h3><p>The following sections list the question posed by the tool alongside the answer that best fits what we know about the KDevelop project.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/posts/commarchreport/icons8-law-64.png\" alt=\"Icon of a gavel.

The biggest challenge facing KDevelop’s longevity is in dealing with the market climate. Although a powerful and popular program, there isn’t much in the way of commercial support.

Describe software project, its purpose and goals.</strong></p>\n<p>KDevelop is a cross-platform, multi-language integrated development environment (IDE) under the KDE Community banner. KDevelop is free and open-source software, providing support for a variety of markup and programming languages through its extensible plugin-based architecture with additional localization support in several languages. </p>\n<p>Most KDevelop contributors are volunteers who work on the project in their spare time, but, there are currently <strong>four Core Developers</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"mailto:kfunk@kde.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Kevin Funk</a> (Co-maintainer)</li>\n<li><a href=\"mailto:svenbrauch@gmail.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Sven Brauch</a> (Co-maintainer)</li>\n<li><a href=\"mail@milianw.de\">Milian Wolff</a> (Generic Manager)</li>\n<li><a href=\"aleixpol@gmail.com\">Aleix Pol Gonzalez</a> (CMake/Run/Kross/Git Support)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>KDevelop is a reliable and powerful environment for developers and is FLOSS software. As part of the KDE Community, this application also joins the goal of making a consistent Kool Desktop Environment.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>B.  Give brief history of the project. When was the Initial Commit? The latest commit?</strong></p>\n<p>The earliest days of KDevelop found its first 0.1 Alpha version announced on the <a href=\"https://marc.info/?l=kde-announce&amp;m=90648146015087&amp;w=2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">kde-announce</a> mailing list - on September 22nd, 1998, developers Sandy Meier, Stefan Heidrich, and Stefan Bartel hosted the unstable tarball package on KDE’s FTP server. KDevelop has changed significantly since those early days, and its most recent long term support (LTS) incarnation - <a href=\"https://github.com/KDE/kdevelop/releases/tag/v4.0.1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">KDevelop4</a> - was released nine years ago on July 16th, 2010 (<a href=\"https://github.com/KDE/kdevelop/commit/79ca7610af2e303d7ed8940d4fd3798b9786d96e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Commit 79ca761…</a>).</p>\n<p>It wasn’t until the next year, on January 9th, 1999, that the initial work started on KDevelop was moved into a version control system (<a href=\"https://github.com/KDE/kdevelop/commit/f12757c0f4c72b06e9dd77b096250c6f04d7cae1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Commit f12757c…</a>). Described as version 0.2, developers Meier, Heidrich, and Bartel were joined by Ralf Nolden, Jost Schenk, and David Barth. It was during this import into a git repository that the origins of the source code were documented. KDevelop’s original source code drew from KWrite - a text editor in the KDE family maintained by Jochen Wilhemy - and that connection between the applications remains present today. At the time, KDevelop also included test code from ‘kswallowwidget’ that was later removed in the <a href=\"https://marc.info/?l=kde-commits&amp;m=94979406811303&amp;w=2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">next year</a>.</p>\n<p>At the time of writing this entry, the most recent commit (<a href=\"https://github.com/KDE/kdevelop/commit/d5e3e27bb2720d84adda95de07a728a9e61c866f\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Commit d5e3e27…</a>) to KDevelop’s <a href=\"https://github.com/KDE/kdevelop\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">master</a> branch was authored yesterday by Thibault North (<a href=\"https://github.com/tnorth\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">@tnorth</a>) - a member of the Fedora project based in Switzerland - and committed by Milian Wolff (<a href=\"https://github.com/milianw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">@milianw</a>) - a core developer of KDevelop based in Berlin, Germany. The most recent release, <a href=\"https://github.com/KDE/kdevelop/releases/tag/v5.3.2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">v5.3.2</a> (<a href=\"https://github.com/KDE/kdevelop/commit/48bdc10109ca5c0db6938b9eb89ea6890212cbf8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Commit 48bdc10…</a>) was published by Kevin Funk (<a href=\"https://github.com/krf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">@krf</a>), a co-maintainer of the KDevelop project, based in Cologne, Germany.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>C.  Who approves patches? How many people?</strong></p>\n<p>According to the commit review reports on the project’s <a href=\"https://phabricator.kde.org/dashboard/view/8/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Phabricator</a> dashboard, there are a couple of consistent names that appear to be in charge of reviewing commits that are authored. While each of the core developers - Kevin Funk, Sven Brauch, Milian Wolff, and Aleix Pol Gonzalez - are listed as recurring reviewers, it seems that the option to review and approve patches are open to anyone willing to do the work.</p>\n<p>The KDE Community even provides <a href=\"https://community.kde.org/Infrastructure/Phabricator#How_to_review_someone_else.27s_patch\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">documentation</a> for new contributors who are interested in reviewing patches and performing quality assurance on new commits and pull requests. In practice, there were <em>five</em> unique reviewers that would approve commits.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>D.  Who has commit access, or has had patches accepted?  How many total?</strong></p>\n<p>The GitHub <a href=\"https://github.com/KDE/kdevelop\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">repository</a> (and by extension, its mirrors) list 282 unique contributors to the master branch (excluding merge commits). Of those contributors, only four contributors that have been active in the last three years have 1,000 or more commits. This being said, the numbers may be skewed as some core developers, like Milian Wolff, both author and approve patches. Of the contributors who are not presently reviewing patches through Phabricator, there are three with 1,000 or more commits. There are at least 25 other contributors with 100 or more commits over the lifetime of the project.</p>\n<p>KDevelop’s <a href=\"https://www.kdevelop.org/kdevelop-team\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">homepage</a> lists 14 inactive core developers, 2 active contributors, and 4 remaining core developers. If including patches for localization efforts, there are roughly 9 different languages that have supporters.</p>\n<p>In theory, anyone can contribute. Contributors who wish to join the project need only <a href=\"https://www.kdevelop.org/contribute-kdevelop\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">contact</a> the core and active developers via the IRC channel or developer mailing list. Those who have created a new patch without going through that process can also post a request directly to the project’s Phabricator instance. It seems that anyone who follows the developer documentation and reaches out can gain access.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>E.

Has there been any turnover in the Core Team? Has the same top 20% of contributors stayed the same over time? If not, how has it changed?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes, the core team has changed quite a bit over the years, the contributions shifted from 2008-2012 the old KDevelop team stopped working on the project and another team picked it up. This was around the time when Kdevelop 4.x stopped development and KDevelop 5 development began in 2014. There’s a list of 12 inactive core developers and only 4 active ones. Kevin Funk, Sven Brauch, Milian Wolff, and Aleix Pol Gonzales are the current members of the core development team. The <a href=\"https://www.kdevelop.org/kdevelop-team\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">about</a> page has information on all of the major contributors. </p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>H.  Does the project have a BDFL, or Lead Developer? (BDFL == Benevolent Dictator for Life) If not, what is the structure of its leadership, and how is it chosen?</strong></p>\n<p>Kind of, Milian Wolff is the generic manager, while Kevin Funk and Sven Brauch have taken on the role of “Co-maintainers”. There’s no indication of why they were given these roles other than them being pretty active in the git repositories. Funk and Milian seem to be the ones that write the release notes and Wolff takes care of the releases, so he’s the closest to the BDFL.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>I.  Are the front and back end developers the same people? What is the proportion of each?</strong></p>\n<p>Sven Brauch, one of the Co-Maintainers works on User Interface improvements and python support. Hes ¼ of the team and does backend and frontend work. Two of the other members in the team, Woolff and Funk, also work on website development. Since Kdevelop has such a small core team, it’s inevitable that the backend developers work on ui and web development. Since Sven is only responsible for “improvements”, it might not be a very time consuming role, allowing him to also work on Python support.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>J.  What have been some of the major bugs/problems/issues that have arisen during development? Who is responsible for quality control and bug repair?</strong></p>\n<p>KDevelop has had 40 reported bugs labeled as critical. Some of them come from dependency-related issues – having the wrong version of Qt installed has caused a few critical bugs, and bugs in Qt have caused a few more. The work seems to be self-distributed among the contributors, or distributed through a channel other than the bug tracker – very few bugs are officially assigned, and most are just eventually marked fixed with an explanation of the fix.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>K.  How is the project’s participation trending and why?</strong></p>\n<p>KDevelop’s participation has been trending downwards over the past few years. Only two of the four core developers commit regularly now, and one much more than the other. However, it still regularly sees bugs fixed and new features added. It’s unclear why this is happening, but it seems likely that it’s just because KDevelop isn’t a massively popular IDE and the project has been around for a very long time.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>L.  In your opinion, does the project pass “The Raptor Test?” (i.e. Would the project survive if the BDFL, or most active contributor were eaten by a Velociraptor?) Why or why not?</strong></p>\n<p>Not easily. After processing their conflicted feelings – raptors have been revived and someone just <em>died</em> to them – they’d need to learn CMake to account for Aleix Pol’s contributions. However, it would be possible to adapt and move on.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>M.  In your opinion, would the project survive if the core team, or most active 20% of contributors, were hit by a bus? Why or why not?</strong></p>\n<p>Almost definitely not. There’s fairly little contribution from people outside of the core team, and those on the core team account for nearly half of the knowledge.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>N.  Does the project have an official “on-boarding” process in place? (New contributor guides, quickstarts, communication leads who focus specifically on newbies, etc…).</strong></p>\n<p>There is a general <a href=\"https://www.kdevelop.org/contribute-kdevelop\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">invitation</a> for contributors to contact developers on the IRC or through the mailing list if they want to get started. Unfortunately, there doesn’t seem to be one, singular ‘on-boarding’ process that new contributors can utilize to get used to the process. A trip to the <a href=\"https://userbase.kde.org/KDevelop4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">linked documentation page</a> opens with another invitation for people to help extend the documentation itself; it can be overwhelming to join the project if you’re not sure how to get started. The documentation that does point to something useful for new contributors was found on a <a href=\"https://github.com/krf/kdevelop\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">mirror repository</a>, as opposed to the main one.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>O.  Does the project have Documentation available? How extensive is it? Does it include code examples?</strong></p>\n<p>There is several avenues for documentation - including for users, developers, and translators that are a part of the localization effort. Unfortunately, since the release of KDevelop5, the most recent documentation for developers and users has been lacking. With that said, KDevelop4 has been documented extensively. Discussion about using KDevelop also takes place across the many blogs by developers; KDevelop’s homepage provides access to an <a href=\"https://www.kdevelop.org/developer-blogs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">aggregate list</a> that pulls from some of them.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>P.  If you were going to contribute to this project, but ran into trouble or hit blockers, who would you contact, and how?</strong></p>\n<p>The core developers via IRC or the mailing list. Technically, you could contact the developers directly via their email, however, there’s a better chance of getting a timely response when sending this feedback through the mailing list. In addition, conversations about challenges in the public space are healthier for the growth of any FLOSS community - archived discussions in the public space allow future developers the opportunity to learn from the past.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Q.  Based on these answers, how would you describe the decision making structure/process of this group?  Is it hierarchical, consensus building, ruled by a small group, barely contained chaos, or ruled by a single or pair of individuals?</strong></p>\n<p>The structure of this project seems to be both ruled and maintained by a small group of people. It seems that aside from the 4 team members, there are only two other active contributors. Everyone else is either inactive or not acknowledged by the core team. While it seems like the team would like to have more contributors to help with the project, it seems like it would be difficult to start working on.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>R.  Is this the kind of structure you would enjoy working in? Why, or why not?</strong></p>\n<p>I dislike the lack of clarity surrounding the steps new contributors would need to take in order to get involved. Documentation is important for large projects, but, it often seems that development is currently outpacing the speed of the developer documentation itself. The current codebase is so far removed from the initial 1.0 release, that, you’d need to engage with the core developers (who are all in a different timezone) in order to be introduced to how everything works. This could be solved with an on-boarding process for new contributors. From there, it seems they are pretty open to developers patching as they want to, but, it’s hard to gauge the social dynamics of the most recent active contributors - unfortunately, the mailing list rarely is geared towards new participants.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3 id=\"Presentation\"><a href=\"#Presentation\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Presentation\"></a>Presentation</h3><p>The deck accompanying this report can be found <a href=\"https://slides.com/iae2784/deck\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/posts/commarchreport/abstract-success.png\" alt=\"Abstract image reflecting joy and success.\"></p>\n<p><em>This presentation was made with the Slides platform.

This is in preparation for our final project.</p>\n<a id=\"more\"></a>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"The-Basics\"><a href=\"#The-Basics\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"The Basics\"></a>The Basics</h2><p>The <em>New York State Next Generation Mathematics Learning Standards</em> reflect the mathematic standards of New York State. They are, “designed to support student access to the knowledge and understanding of the mathematical concepts that are necessary to function in a world very dependent upon the application of mathematics, while providing educators the opportunity to devise innovative programs to support this endeavor” (pp. 3). </p>\n<p>Published by the New York State Department of Education, you can find the 2017 standards, <a href=\"http://www.nysed.gov/common/nysed/files/programs/curriculum-instruction/nys-next-generation-mathematics-p-12-standards.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>Another document focused specifically on the Grade 4 standards can be found <a href=\"http://www.nysed.gov/common/nysed/files/math-revised-2017-standards-grade-4.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>These standards were last revised in 2017.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"The-Gist\"><a href=\"#The-Gist\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"The Gist\"></a>The Gist</h2><p>For this particular review, students were asked to look at the overview for Grade 4 instruction. Essentially, the pedagogical focus of this section established focus around three areas:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>(1) Fluency with multi-digit multiplication and division.</li>\n<li>(2) Familiarity with fraction arithmetic.</li>\n<li>(3) Understanding of geometric figures and properties such as angles, perpendicularity, and symmetry.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"The-Good\"><a href=\"#The-Good\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"The Good\"></a>The Good</h2><p>The standards provide detailed definitions that plainly lay out expectations of academic progress for students. Examples are clearly presented beside each entry of mathematical content.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"The-Bad\"><a href=\"#The-Bad\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"The Bad\"></a>The Bad</h2><p>The nature of standards to be exact and precise lends itself to being verbose. While this might be useful for identifying what an instructor needs to include when creating curriculum for the classroom, it’s takes a moment to grab the important information. Sections, like the one with a note on procedural fluency on page 59, are written in ways that make the purpose unclear. You might end up halfway through a paragraph before realizing it’s a redundant passage or is simply offering a lengthy ‘precise’ definition for a term that should have been defined earlier in the standard. </p>\n<p>This, however, is something that academia suffers from and is not unique to this mathematics standard. The language used is complex and can definitely be simplified, often feeling like a form of ‘legalese’. This makes the writing less accessible to people who simply want to know what type of math needs to be taught to grade schoolers. </p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"Q-amp-A\"><a href=\"#Q-amp-A\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Q&amp;A\"></a>Q&amp;A</h2><ul>\n<li><p>What are some example problems that students would have to solve for a particular mathematical concept?</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Are some problems more suited than others for teaching the subject at hand? As an example, are visual exercises with models and diagrams easier for students learning fraction arithmetic over word problems? Are both types necessary? If so, does the final product need to anticipate including them?</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"Follow-Up\"><a href=\"#Follow-Up\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Follow-Up\"></a>Follow-Up</h2><p>In this particular case, the take away is that Grade 4 students are expected to engage with fractional math and deal with multiplication/division arithmetic. For the final product, an activity on the Sugar platform that engages students with fractional math exercises may be a great choice of focus.</p>\n<p>A visual representation of fraction multiplication and division might be one direction for an educational game. Another learning activity might deal with geometric properties and concepts. When coming up with a final project proposal for the course, referencing these mathematical practices will be helpful, making the standard an invaluable resource for that purpose.</p>\n","date_published":"2019-03-20T07:32:31.000Z","date_modified":"2019-03-20T07:48:25.174Z","author":{"name":"Ian Effendi","url":"http://rimij405.github.io"},"tags":"blog,hfoss"},{"id":"http://rimij405.github.io/blog/hfoss/commarchteam/","url":"http://rimij405.github.io/blog/hfoss/commarchteam/","external_url":"","title":"Community Archictecture Analysis: Team Proposal","link":"http://rimij405.github.io/blog/hfoss/commarchteam/","summary":"","content_html":"<h1 id=\"Team-Proposal\"><a href=\"#Team-Proposal\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Team Proposal\"></a>Team Proposal</h1><p>This blog post serves as a proposal for the community architecture analysis of KDEvelop.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Team-Members\"><a href=\"#Team-Members\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Team Members\"></a>Team Members</h2><ul>\n<li>Nic Hartley</li>\n<li><p><a href=\"mailto:nxh9052@rit.edu\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">nxh9052@rit.edu</a></p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Joshua Schenk</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><a href=\"mailto:jks7743@rit.edu\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">jks7743@rit.edu</a></p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Ian Effendi</p>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"mailto:iae2784@rit.edu\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">iae2784@rit.edu</a> </li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"Project\"><a href=\"#Project\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Project\"></a>Project</h2><p>Our team is performing an analysis on the community architecture of the <a href=\"https://www.kdevelop.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">KDEvelop</a> IDE.</p>\n<p>KDevelop is a cross-platform, multi-language IDE, with a wide variety of integrations.

Eghbal explores the production and economic models behind open-source software, and had <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/nadiaeghbal/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">previously worked at GitHub</a>, building programs, products, and partnerships to better support open-source developers.</p>\n<p>In July of 2016, Eghbal published <em>Roads and Bridges</em>, a deeper look at the maintainance required of our digital infrastructure. Likening this massive support system (with an unprecedented demand) to physical infrastructure (<em>a la</em> roads and bridges), Eghbal draws out support for the great work that open source developers do - and highlight the challenges that come with sustaining that infrastructure.</p>\n<p>In addition to writing longform research on open-source software, Eghbal has written extensively on the subject in <a href=\"https://medium.com/@nayafia\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">shortform</a> and has been a part of <a href=\"https://changelog.com/rfc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">podcasts that highlight</a> the <a href=\"https://hopeinsource.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">culture of open source</a>.</p>\n<p>You can find more of her research on her personal website, <a href=\"https://nadiaeghbal.com/research/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"The-Gist\"><a href=\"#The-Gist\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"The Gist\"></a>The Gist</h2><p>Eghbal’s work is a detailed retelling of the open-source history, reaching as far back as 1998, when OpenSSL was first created between a group of security experts in the UK. OpenSSL - a cybersecurity project that is known for enabling websites with the ability to transmit sensitive data over the internet - was recently susceptible to Heartbleed, a dire security flaw overlooked by its handful of maintainers. </p>\n<p>But, OpenSSL is used by millions around the world - the internet wouldn’t exist as it does today without it. OpenSSL’s problems are indicative of a recurring issue in the open-source community’s narrative: the use of free software without the support to maintain it.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"The-Good\"><a href=\"#The-Good\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"The Good\"></a>The Good</h2><ul>\n<li>1) There is a great encouragement in the writing to reuse and borrow from what others have created before.</li>\n<li>2)  Free software makes building empowering software accessible and possible to those with limited funds.</li>\n<li>3) The sheer size and wealth of material that Eghbal presents is crucial and necessary to understanding the full context of open source history: the fact that such material has been released for free access to all is just as telling of where Eghbal stands on the conversation.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"The-Bad\"><a href=\"#The-Bad\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"The Bad\"></a>The Bad</h2><ul>\n<li>1) New developers who consistently build projects using tools from others before them may never gain a deeper understanding of the work they create.</li>\n<li>2) Developers without a deep understanding of the work that they create rely on possibly insecure services and infrastructure that could collapse - the more who use a particular project as a dependency without understanding it, the greater the risk becomes of system-wide failure. (See: <a href=\"https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/19883\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">NPM/Node pre-release mayhem</a>).</li>\n<li>3) The greater the gap in skill, the harder it will be for younger developers to fill the holes left by older developers. People can’t work on software forever and it needs to be maintained; but software today is, “deteriorating,” due to the lack of funding and contributions (pp. 76).</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"Q-amp-A\"><a href=\"#Q-amp-A\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Q&amp;A\"></a>Q&amp;A</h2><ul>\n<li>1) What organizations are actively contributing to the problems at hand?</li>\n<li>2) What can be done to keep companies investing in open source over the years?</li>\n<li>3) Are our communities of software too big to fail?

In addition to mood, users would be able to keep track of other daily life events (such as drinks of water, hours of sleep, hours of exercise, and meals in one day). From there, users are able to take the data they own and visualize the results across a day, a week, a month, and even a year.</p>\n<h3 id=\"The-Frontend-s\"><a href=\"#The-Frontend-s\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"The Frontend(s?)\"></a>The Frontend(s?)</h3><p>We created an intentionally detached API for the backend to allow a community of mindful users the opportunity to create a cross-platform ecosystem.</p>\n<p>Our interpretation resulted in a React-powered web client, but, there was discussion of creating a native Flutter/Dart mobile application.</p>\n<h3 id=\"The-Backend\"><a href=\"#The-Backend\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"The Backend\"></a>The Backend</h3><p>The exposed API is powered by <a href=\"\">MongoDB</a> and <a href=\"\">NodeJS</a>. We want to make sure that our backend remains scalable and accessible from multiple endpoints: each mood entry is stored in a Binary JSON (BSON) format, taking up little space while remaining quick to query. </p>\n<p>The data itself is flexible and the JSON document format offers many avenues to converting for use in other ecosystems. The goal of keeping the backend detached is to keep development agile and flexible. </p>\n<p>NodeJS’s non-blocking I/O was perfect for our needs. We had to choose between a <a href=\"https://www.soapui.org/learn/api/soap-vs-rest-api.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">SOAP-style</a>,  a <a href=\"https://medium.freecodecamp.org/building-a-simple-node-js-api-in-under-30-minutes-a07ea9e390d2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">REST-style</a>, and a <a href=\"https://scotch.io/@alloys/how-to-build-an-rpc-based-api-with-nodejs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">RPC-style</a> API. </p>\n<p>SOAP wraps payload information in an XML format, making it language-agnostic. REST models domain resources and entities, making CRUD operations available for all the data. RPC is great for interacting with the backend through commands/procedures.</p>\n<p>At the end of the day, we chose to go forth with an RPC API. But nothing’s stopping us from adding to our system. The API endpoint contains, importantly, an ‘API Version’ field that can be queried to choose how we (and others) want to handle their data in the future.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Data-Ownership\"><a href=\"#Data-Ownership\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Data Ownership\"></a>Data Ownership</h3><p><img src=\"/images/posts/brickhack-v/screenshot.jpg\" alt=\"Screenshot from the application.\"></p>\n<p>We’ve released the code under the permissive open-source <a href=\"https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">MIT License</a> to encourage other people to take control of their data, and keep track of their mental health without having to pay for an application.</p>\n<p>Use the <code>frontend</code> branch to get access to a react-based web-client.

Although it was originally written in French, Beckett’s English language version of the material was voted, “the most significant English language play of the 20th century,” in a 1990 poll conducted by the British Royal National Theatre.</p>\n<p>Godot was formed in 2007 by Juan ‘reduz’ Linietsky and Ariel ‘punto’ Manzur. According to Linietsky, the name <em>Godot</em> was chosen to represent their never-ending wish of adding new features to the engine, always pushing off an exhaustive product. It wasn’t until February of 2014 - seven years later - that the source code would be published on GitHub and it wasn’t until the end of that year for Godot to reach version 1.0 - it’s first stable release.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Features\"><a href=\"#Features\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Features\"></a>Features</h2><p>At the time of writing this, Godot’s last stable release (v.3.0.6) was released in July of 2018 - and development is on-going. The engine itself runs on several operating systems, including <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Windows</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">macOS</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Linux</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_Software_Distribution\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">BSD</a>, and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haiku_(operating_system\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Haiku</a>). (<em>Fun fact about Haiku - it’s an open source operating system supported by Haiku, Inc., a non-profit organization based in Rochester, New York, founded by <a href=\"https://www.haiku-os.org/blog/koki/2009-11-28_history_channel_2003_interview_michael_phipps/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Michael Phipps</a>, Computer Science graduate of Rochester Institute of Technology, Class of ‘97</em>). Games made with Godot can target desktop, mobile, and web platforms, using Godot’s export template system. It’s easy to create custom builds as well, if the existing templates don’t cut it.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Compact\"><a href=\"#Compact\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Compact\"></a>Compact</h3><p>Godot is a small engine - roughly 20 MB in size - and is very easy to compile. It comes with a built-in debugger, profiler (with graph plotting and time seeking), that allows for projects to be modified, even while they’re running. Changes made while live are persistent - a design choice that some engines don’t have.</p>\n<h3 id=\"It’s-in-the-Node\"><a href=\"#It’s-in-the-Node\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"It’s in the Node\"></a>It’s in the Node</h3><p>Godot adpots a Scene- and Node-based hiearchy as its approach to game development. Everything in Godot is a Node and nodes can be (infinitely) nested. The visual editor that comes with Godot makes it friendly, inviting, and easy-to-use for creators at any level of the game development pipeline.</p>\n<p>Godot’s configuration and project files are version control friendly - feel free to make liberal use of your diff command. Godot also utilizes a custom scripting language (GDScript) that was written explicitly for the engine - GDScript’s syntax is also supported by GitHub, so it enjoys some of the same privileges of its older cousins.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Scripting\"><a href=\"#Scripting\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Scripting\"></a>Scripting</h3><p>While GDScript is a Python-like language meant explicitly for Godot, it’s not the only one available. The latest stable release has full C# 7.0 support (using Mono), support for a visual scripting system using blocks and connectors, and full native C++ support without the need to recompile the engine (through the use of a core-module dynamic). The GDNative aspect of the project exposes the engine’s native C symbol API that allows developers to create and utilize bindings to other languages if they so wish - bindings already exist for Python, Nim, and D, among other languages.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Animation\"><a href=\"#Animation\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Animation\"></a>Animation</h3><p>Everything in Godot was built with animation in mind: from bones and objects to function calls themselves, everything can be tweened. </p>\n<h2 id=\"Godot-vs-Unity\"><a href=\"#Godot-vs-Unity\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Godot vs. Unity\"></a>Godot vs. Unity</h2><p><img src=\"/images/posts/waiting-for-godot/editor.png\" alt=\"Picture of editor.\"></p>\n<p>Godot supports both 2D and 3D game development. While this is what draws the largest comparison to the <a href=\"https://unity3d.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Unity3D</a> game engine, there are three crucial differences. By all means, Godot is not a perfect engine, but, knowing where it excels can help you make a decision about which engine to choose.</p>\n<h3 id=\"No-Nest-To-Call-Home\"><a href=\"#No-Nest-To-Call-Home\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"No Nest To Call Home\"></a>No Nest To Call Home</h3><p>Unity doesn’t allow you to use nested prefabs; all prefab instances will overwrite internal prefabs once ‘nested’. While Unity encourages composability over inheritance, it seems like a missed area to not allow prefabs to be components and children of other prefabs. Godot’s node-based system gets around this issue.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Pixel-Perfect-2D\"><a href=\"#Pixel-Perfect-2D\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Pixel Perfect 2D\"></a>Pixel Perfect 2D</h3><p>Unity3D developers can create 2D games, but, it often comes with the overhead of running a 3D game engine on top of that. Godot’s 2D engine is fully dedicated 2D and is not just a repurposed 3D approximation of 2D. This advantage allows developers to create pixel-perfect gameplay, utilize 2D lights and normal maps, and animate 2D rigs with skeletons and IK. Unity can get the job done, but, your mileage may vary.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Unity-is-Proprietary\"><a href=\"#Unity-is-Proprietary\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Unity is Proprietary\"></a>Unity is Proprietary</h3><p>Unity3D is free as in free pizza. It’s not an open source game engine, unlike Godot, so when you want to expand a particular feature set, you’re stuck waiting for the Unity team to get around to fixing it.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Godot-vs-Cocos2d-x\"><a href=\"#Godot-vs-Cocos2d-x\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Godot vs. Cocos2d-x\"></a>Godot vs. Cocos2d-x</h2><p><img src=\"/images/posts/waiting-for-godot/cocos-creator.png\" alt=\"CocosCreator Logo.\"></p>\n<p>If you’re looking for an alternative to Godot, <a href=\"https://cocos2d-x.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Cocos2d-x based editor CocosCreator</a> is a great open source engine with its own community supporting it.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Ease-of-Use\"><a href=\"#Ease-of-Use\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Ease of Use\"></a>Ease of Use</h2><p><img src=\"/images/posts/waiting-for-godot/chrome-trip.gif\" alt=\"Chrome Trip by @enthus1ast\"></p>\n<p><em><a href=\"https://code0.itch.io/chrome-trip\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Chrome Trip by @enthus1ast</a>.

Ariel Manzur, co-founder of OKAM Studios and Godot, led a team of industry newcomers in the design of adventure game <em>Dog Mendonça &amp; Pizzaboy</em>. Godot, in some ways, was built by its founders to help express the desire for a more visual approach to game development, without necessarily sacrificing the power that comes with engines like <a href=\"https://unity3d.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Unity3D</a> and <a href=\"https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/what-is-unreal-engine-4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Unreal</a>.</p>\n<p>Teachers at a West Virginia high school have used Godot as a way to address the state’s 2016 <a href=\"http://careertech.k12.wv.us/OCTIWebsiteRevisions/16Clusters/InformationTechnologyMainPage.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">coding, app, and game design curriculum</a>.  There’s plenty of room for students to learn game development while introducing them to the concept of free (as in free speech) software.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Open-Source-amp-Diverse-Community\"><a href=\"#Open-Source-amp-Diverse-Community\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Open Source &amp; Diverse Community\"></a>Open Source &amp; Diverse Community</h2><p>There is no question behind Godot’s status as free, open source software.

On June 22nd, 2016, Godot received a $20,000 Mozilla Open Source Support (MOSS) “Mission Partners” award to incorporate Web Sockets, WebAssembly, and WebGL support. It has the acknowledgement of the big names in open source, and, the community is very active. There are currently 4,045 open and 11,267 closed issues on the <a href=\"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">upstream repository</a>.

Tatham, however, is famous for creating and maintaining <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PuTTY\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">PuTTY</a>, an open-source implementation of Telnet and Secure Shell (SSH) clients for Unix and Windows platforms. It’s fair to say that Tatham has experience with reporting and solving bugs in open-source software.</p>\n<p>From the jump, Tatham plainly states the purpose of this guide: reading it will help developers write, “clear, helpful, <em>informative</em> bug reports.” By appraoching the written work with prepared examples and instances of unhelpful reporting practices, Tatham is able to help readers troubleshoot their own bug reporting practices. Notice you’re following a bad practice - this enables you to safely learn from that mistake and adjust course.</p>\n<p>You can find this essay on Simon Tatham’s personal website, <a href=\"https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/bugs.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"The-Gist\"><a href=\"#The-Gist\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"The Gist\"></a>The Gist</h2><p>This guide helps users report bugs to programmers.

While useful for other developers for providing informative bug reports, the generalized presentation doesn’t help programmers know what questions to ask. That process is something you’ll learn largely from practice, experience, and a strong understanding of the codebase. This isn’t necessarily a bad thing, but, this can be a barrier for new contributers.</li>\n<li>3) It doesn’t mention what users should do in the event repositories are archived.

I really want to go back and revisit the work that I started in this context. Luckily the very permissive license projects are given upon submission to the game jam mean there’s an opportunity for me to go back and improve on those initial ideas. </p>\n<p>Game development is an iterative process; I felt there was a disconnect between my work (as a programmer) and the artwork being completed by my peers. There was a lot more time-to-polish for my work than theirs! This helped me become more comfortable with working through messy work and pushing to get a stronger level of quality.</p>\n<p>Every project that I’ve taken on since then has increased in difficulty and I’m getting closer and closer to meeting what I think is a desirable level of quality.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Next-Steps\"><a href=\"#Next-Steps\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Next Steps\"></a>Next Steps</h3><p>I’m looking forward to revisiting some of my older game projects with this new experience.

Cryptology? Cryptography? Aren’t they the same thing?</p>\n<p>Well, according to <a href=\"https://crypto.stackexchange.com/users/23623/sejpm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">@SEJPM</a> and <a href=\"https://crypto.stackexchange.com/users/29574/lery\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>@Lery</em></a> over at the Crypto StackExchange, there are a couple of related terms that tend to be used <a href=\"https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/57818/is-there-any-difference-between-cryptography-and-cryptology\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">interchangeably</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Semantics\"><a href=\"#Semantics\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Semantics\"></a>Semantics</h3><p>To get down to the semantics:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Cryptology</em> is the study of cryptography (Definition 1.1) and cryptanalysis.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In other words, it’s referred to as the, “science of cryptography.”</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Cryptography</em> is the study of mathematical techniques related to aspects of information security such as confidentiality, data integrity, entity authentication, and data origin authentication.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Cryptography deals with the actual security, in practice. There’s also one other term:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Cryptanalysis</em> is the study of mathematical techniques for attempting to defeat cryptographic techniques, and, more generally, information security services.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That’s where the techniques are used to evaluate cryptographic practices. It’s good to keep these things in mind when we talk about modern cryptology.</p>\n<h3 id=\"The-Past\"><a href=\"#The-Past\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"The Past\"></a>The Past</h3><p>While the actual study of the practice is relatively young - <a href=\"https://access.redhat.com/blogs/766093/posts/1976023\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">within 100 years, according to Huzaifa Sidhpurwala</a> - cryptography itself has been around for thousands of years. The encryption of messages by hand have been used to keep sensitive secrets away from prying eyes; one of the earliest known and simplest ciphers in history is known as the <a href=\"http://practicalcryptography.com/ciphers/caesar-cipher/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Caeser cipher, or substitution cipher</a>. It took it’s name from Julius Caeser who used it to keep military communications secret.</p>\n<h3 id=\"The-Now\"><a href=\"#The-Now\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"The Now\"></a>The Now</h3><p>Security on the interet, in some ways, hasn’t changed. We still encrypt our text and we still rely on messages that travel between endpoints. Today we use public-key cryptography, or asymmetric cryptography, in various sceruity models ranging from authentication, authorization, and more.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Authentication\"><a href=\"#Authentication\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Authentication\"></a>Authentication</h2><p>When our client reaches out to our server/host, one crucial part in the step is to authenticate both parties.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Client-Side\"><a href=\"#Client-Side\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Client-Side\"></a>Client-Side</h3><p>On the client-side, this might look like a host key fingerprint. By keeping track of this information, the client can verify that the host on the other side of the connection is, in fact, who they say they are.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Server-Side\"><a href=\"#Server-Side\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Server-Side\"></a>Server-Side</h3><p>If the server is given a public key by the client, it can check to ensure the client has the accompanying private key whenever it connects. If the key is given passphrase protection, the client is responsible for authenticating the key before it can be trusted by the server as well!</p>\n<h2 id=\"SSH\"><a href=\"#SSH\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"SSH\"></a>SSH</h2><p>Secure Shell (SSH) is a cryptographic <a href=\"https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">remote login program</a>, providing a secure channel over an unsecured network in client-server architecture. We can use applications that leverage this protocol to do things like manage files remotely, update repositories, and transfer files.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/posts/mission-authentication/pankaj-patel-large.jpg\" alt=\"Screenshot of GitHub ssh session - Image by Pankaj Patel\"></p>\n<p>One strategy for securing this channel is through the use of the public-key cryptography. With great power comes great responsibility: the ability to execute command remotely is great for DevOps and sysadmins, but, the remote communication can be exposed to a lot of third-party actors.</p>\n<p><strong>PasswordAuthentication</strong></p>\n<p>Logging into a secure shell remotely can vary depending on the host’s settings, but, for the most part, clients typically connect to a host by providing a username, hostname, and port. The most basic of authentication allows users to enter a password (that is sent as cleartext) over the network. While this is the easiest way to remote login to a server, it’s also the least secure.</p>\n<p><strong>ChallengeResponseAuthentication</strong></p>\n<p>Similar to PasswordAuthentication, users have to enter a password through a keyboard-interactive terminal in order to successfully authenticate their client to the host. Unlike PasswordAuthentication, this Authentication protocol can vary in security. Sometimes known as the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Challenge-Handshake_Authentication_Protocol\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Challenge-Handshake Authentication Protocol</a> (CHAP), the host issues a challenge to the client. Once received, the client will combine that challenge with a secret that’s shared between them - this is usually the password - and calculate a hashed value from it, before sending that value back to the host. The host, which should have the expected shared secret already stored, will calculate the expected value on its end before comparing it to the response from the client. If the challenge is successfully met (meaning the user input the correct shared secret), the authentication is considered successful. Some versions will allow the host to send new challenges to the client at random intervals to continually check the authenticity of the client.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Key-Fingerprints\"><a href=\"#Key-Fingerprints\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Key Fingerprints\"></a>Key Fingerprints</h3><p>In public-key cryptography, a public key fingerprint is a short sequence of bytes used to identify a longer public key. Fingerprints are created by applying a cryptographic hash function to a public key. Since fingerprints are shorter than the keys they refer to, they can be used to simplify certain key management tasks.</p>\n<p>These keys are meant to be human readable for the purposes of identification: often public keys will be encoded into hexadecimal strings like below:</p>\n<p><code>43:51:43:a1:b5:fc:8b:b7:0a:3a:a9:b1:0f:66:73:a8</code></p>\n<p>Fingerprints won’t always look like the MD5 hash above. SHA-1 fingerprints are often nothing more than a string of hexadecimal digits: <code>2fd4e1c67a2d28fced849ee1bb76e7391b93eb12</code>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"ssh-keygen\"><a href=\"#ssh-keygen\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"ssh-keygen\"></a>ssh-keygen</h3><p><code>ssh-keygen</code> is a command line tool that <a href=\"https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">generates, manages, and converts authentication keys</a> for SSH. Keys generated with this tool default to the OpenSSH-specific format. Generally, a user will generate the public key and indicate where to store the private key, before protecting them with a passphrase. While the names can be changed, in the OpenSSH format, private keys are stored in plaintext without a file extension and public keys are given the, ‘.pub’ file extension. Although they are stored in plaintext, the data held inside them is a mix of randomly generated content based on an crpytographic algorithm. Knowing the content of one file in isolation does little to risk the host as they can easily be revoked. (This does, however, require the sysadmin know of a breach).</p>\n<p>The tool can also be used to check the fingerprints of certain keys! Host keys are created without a passphrase as they serve as identity markers more so than authentication checks.</p>\n<p>The following command takes a public host key created with the ED25519 algorithm, and outputs the fingerprint as an MD5 hash:</p>\n<p><code>ssh-keygen -l -E md5 -f ssh_host_ed25519_key.pub</code>.</p>\n<p>By default, the fingerprint command will display a SHA256 hash:</p>\n<p><code>ssh-keygen -lf ssh_host_ed25519_key.pub</code></p>\n<p>Knowing how to get a particular formatted hash is important when checking if a host’s fingerprint has changed.</p>\n<h3 id=\"PuTTY\"><a href=\"#PuTTY\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"PuTTY\"></a>PuTTY</h3><p>One method for setting up SSH Public-key cryptography is with <a href=\"https://www.putty.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">PuTTY</a>, a terminal emulator that can act as a client for SSH, Telnet, rlogin, and raw TCP communication protocols.</p>\n<p>PuTTY is joined by a few additional applications that are often run in its suite, such as PuTTYgen, an asymmetric cryptography key generation utility. Their application allows you to generate a public and private key for use in the system. In this case, private keys can be exported to the open-source OpenSSH format or as a PuTTY Private-key (*.ppk) file, a propriatary format.</p>\n<p>You can also control the host key algorithm preference when authenticating to a host for the first time. If a client doesn’t have a key in one algorithm, it will move onto the next algorithm in the preference list.</p>\n<h3 id=\"ssh-agent\"><a href=\"#ssh-agent\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"ssh-agent\"></a>ssh-agent</h3><p>The <code>ssh-agent</code> is a program that <a href=\"https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-agent.1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">holds private keys used for public-key cryptography authentication</a>. Initially, a system’s ssh-agent will not have any private keys, but, as users <code>ssh-add</code> private keys to the client, they’ll be able to authenticate automatically when the host requests their key.</p>\n<p>The general process is to generate both a public and private key, before placing the public key on the host. The client keeps track of the local private key and presents it upon SSH login to a remote host. When the host uses the public key to request the private key, if the client does not have the private key, times out, or cannot enter the correct passphrase after a set amount of attempts, the authentication process will fail.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Final-Thoughts\"><a href=\"#Final-Thoughts\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Final Thoughts\"></a>Final Thoughts</h2><p>Certifications on the Secure Socket Layer and Secure Shell logins both require public-key cryptography in order to remain secure. These algorithms are not bullet proof, but, they can take a very long time to brute force and crack.</p>\n<p>At the end of the day, keys are generated in a pseudorandom process; it will always remain theoretically possible to crack algorithmic security systems, so long as there is an infinite amount of time and processing power.</p>\n<p>That shouldn’t scare you from securing your server and your platforms! It is unrealistic to expect anyone to crack the toughest of algorithms (short of an unknown backdoor exploitation) within any sort of reasonable amount of time, in today’s age of technological dreams.</p>\n<p>While I’m not new to being a system admin for Linux-based servers, I am paying more attention to the security that protects my data and information. You should too!</p>\n","date_published":"2019-01-25T03:09:42.000Z","date_modified":"2019-03-19T22:31:10.153Z","author":{"name":"Ian Effendi","url":"http://rimij405.github.io"},"tags":"blog,cybersecurity"},{"id":"http://rimij405.github.io/blog/hfoss/next-steps/","url":"http://rimij405.github.io/blog/hfoss/next-steps/","external_url":"","title":"Next Steps","link":"http://rimij405.github.io/blog/hfoss/next-steps/","summary":"<h1 id=\"The-Way-It-Goes\"><a href=\"#The-Way-It-Goes\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"The Way It Goes\"></a>The Way It Goes</h1><p>I recently read <a href=\"https://dev.to/dechamp/25-years-of-coding-and-im-just-beginning-442n\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">25 years of coding, and I’m just beginning</a> by dev.to user DeChamp, and found some intriguing responses across the web.

Let’s take a look at how this site was made, shall we?</p>\n<a id=\"more\"></a>\n<h2 id=\"First-Flight\"><a href=\"#First-Flight\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"First Flight\"></a>First Flight</h2><h3 id=\"IRC\"><a href=\"#IRC\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"IRC\"></a>IRC</h3><p>I decided to use <a href=\"https://hexchat.github.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">HexChat</a>, and registered my nick: effendiian.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Email\"><a href=\"#Email\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Email\"></a>Email</h3><p>I signed up for the <a href=\"https://lists.rit.edu/mailman/listinfo.mmcgi/floss-seminar\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">floss-seminar discussion</a> mailing list!</p>\n<h2 id=\"Getting-Started\"><a href=\"#Getting-Started\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Getting Started\"></a>Getting Started</h2><p>Finally I was ready to work on my blog. After I put on my Spotify playlist of, “<a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/user/1271966423/playlist/6MlIJGplHSLlgmQgb0BKpw?si=khc3sdT-Sce904oMTdbeKQ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Iconic, Inspirational, and Intriguing</a>“ orcheastral music, it was time to get to work. Before I could choose a framework to get started with, I needed to <em>know</em> what it was that I wanted to create.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Priority-Features\"><a href=\"#Priority-Features\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Priority Features\"></a>Priority Features</h3><p>The term <a href=\"https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/blog\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>blog</em></a> is the shortened form of <em>weblog</em>, a term coined by Jorn Barger in the early days of the internet. It’s a space for authors to journal thoughts and share them publicly. As such, there are a series of features expected of modern blog format websites.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Publish posts</strong>. It’s important that the time it takes to write and publish entries is quick, painless, and easy. The simpler the process is, the better.</li>\n<li><strong>Use an RSS feed</strong>. This is necessary for my own personal needs; RSS/ATOM feeds are incredibly useful for aggregators and I would like to incorporate that with my solution.</li>\n<li><strong>Open source</strong>. A big part of my work is going to emphasize open source technologies. It’s only fitting that the blog itself is built with open source tools as well.</li>\n<li><strong>Free hosting</strong>. Less of a user feature and more of a development limitation, the website needs to be hosted for free. The budget is nil. Zilch. Nada. Free.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"Secondary-Features\"><a href=\"#Secondary-Features\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Secondary Features\"></a>Secondary Features</h3><p>These additional features are great for quality of life and I kept them in mind while searching for the tools that I would use in order to make the blog.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Multimedia support</strong>. Not all my work involves code. Graphic design, artwork, and animations that I create should be able to reside on the website.</li>\n<li><strong>Customizable Theme</strong>. I like to have control over my website’s layout. This way, I can iterate the design across several periods of development, instead of implementing everything all at once.</li>\n<li><strong>Comment System</strong>. Allowing people to comment on my articles would not be a bad idea.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"What-Type-of-Website\"><a href=\"#What-Type-of-Website\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"What Type of Website\"></a>What Type of Website</h2><p>I’ll be hosting my website on GitHub using <a href=\"https://help.github.com/articles/using-a-static-site-generator-other-than-jekyll/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>GitHub Pages</strong></a> - but I won’t be using <a href=\"https://jekyllrb.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Jekyll</a>. Instead, I’ll be using the static-site generator Hexo, for these reasons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Easy GitHub Pages publishing</strong>. While Jekyll does have GitHub pages support and integration, the differences needed in order to host Hexo’s generated sites are minimal.</li>\n<li><strong>Extensibility with NodeJS</strong>. The NodeJS integration delivers the rich package ecosystem on npm (and yarn) to Hexo developers.</li>\n<li><strong>Speedy</strong>. Node is speedy; as a result, Hexo generates its static files in a matter of seconds. This is one advantage to using Hexo over Jekyll:</li>\n<li><strong>Unopinionated Asset Handling</strong>. Unlike Jekyll, Hexo doesn’t come with an asset pipeline for pre-processing assests by default. Instead, you’re encouraged to roll what works for your setup using Node utilities.</li>\n<li><strong>Template How You Want To</strong>. Hexo contains support for several types of templating engines, including <a href=\"https://github.com/paularmstrong/swig\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Swig</a> (by default), <a href=\"https://github.com/hexojs/hexo-renderer-ejs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">EJS</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/hexojs/hexo-renderer-haml\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Haml</a>, and <a href=\"https://github.com/hexojs/hexo-renderer-jade\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Jade</a>/<a href=\"https://github.com/maxknee/hexo-render-pug\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Pug</a>. Although good, Jekyll is limited to the Liquid templating engine.</li>\n<li><strong>Local CMS</strong>. Both Hexo and Jekyll have this option that isn’t true for all static-site generators; access to a local development CMS through <a href=\"https://github.com/jaredly/hexo-admin\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Hexo Admin</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-admin\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Jekyll Admin</a>, respectively.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"The-JAMStack\"><a href=\"#The-JAMStack\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"The JAMStack\"></a>The JAMStack</h2><p>By using Hexo to create content and hosting my static content on GitHub Pages, we end up with a website that’s been built on what’s known as the <a href=\"https://jamstack.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">JAMStack</a>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>J</strong>avaScript<br><strong>A</strong>PIs<br><strong>M</strong>arkup</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>JAM is sticky and it holds the pieces all together. There are benefits (as listed on <a href=\"https://jamstack.org/best-practices/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">their site</a>) that come with using this stack.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Working-With-Hexo\"><a href=\"#Working-With-Hexo\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Working With Hexo\"></a>Working With Hexo</h2><p>Hexo’s extensibility offers a lot of power if you’re willing to put in the extra work to set things up. By default, Hexo projects are initialized with a standard set of plugins and is installed with the default theme, <a href=\"https://github.com/hexojs/hexo-theme-landscape\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Landscape</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Plugins\"><a href=\"#Plugins\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Plugins\"></a>Plugins</h3><p>I used these additional plugins while setting up the site:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/adamsiwiec/hexagon\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Hexagon</a> - Package manager for installing Hexo plugins and themes.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/hexojs/hexo-generator-archive\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Archive Generator</a> - Generates a blog post archive.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/hexojs/hexo-generator-feed\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Feed Generator</a> - Generates feed for ATOM or RSS2 aggregators.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/hexo-generator-search\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Search Generator</a> - Generates a search index with configuration options available.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/hexojs/hexo-deployer-git\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Git Deployer</a> - Allows Hexo to deploy to a git repository.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"Themes\"><a href=\"#Themes\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Themes\"></a>Themes</h3><p>I used this theme for my website:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/probberechts/hexo-theme-cactus\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Cactus (Dark)</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This should give a good overview of how this website was created. All that’s left is to put up some posts on the website itself!</p>\n<h2 id=\"Tools\"><a href=\"#Tools\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Tools\"></a>Tools</h2><p>I used the following open source tools during the creation of this website.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Joplin\"><a href=\"#Joplin\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Joplin\"></a><a href=\"https://joplin.cozic.net/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Joplin</a></h3><p>Joplin is a free, open source note taking and to-do application, which can handle a large number of notes organised into notebooks. The notes are searchable, can be copied, tagged and modified either from the applications directly or from your own text editor. The notes are in Markdown format. This was useful for drafting blog posts and keeping track of all the resources I needed to use.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Draw-io\"><a href=\"#Draw-io\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Draw.io\"></a><a href=\"https://github.com/jgraph/drawio/blob/master/LICENSE\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Draw.io</a></h3><p>Useful for putting up wireframes when designing website layouts.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Hexo-gitignore\"><a href=\"#Hexo-gitignore\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Hexo .gitignore\"></a><a href=\"https://gist.github.com/spacemonkey/0a9a69004c11f82fc894\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Hexo .gitignore</a></h3><p>Used this .gitignore file as the base of my own.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Real-Favicon-Generator\"><a href=\"#Real-Favicon-Generator\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Real Favicon Generator\"></a><a href=\"https://realfavicongenerator.net/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Real Favicon Generator</a></h3><p>Used to create the favicon for the browser and for other application platforms (iOS, Android, etc.).</p>\n<h3 id=\"Game-Icons\"><a href=\"#Game-Icons\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Game-Icons\"></a><a href=\"https://game-icons.net/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Game-Icons</a></h3><p>Ever growing collection of free game icons.
