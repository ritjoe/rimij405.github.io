# [Global Game Jam 2019](https://globalgamejam.org/news/time-go-home-ggj19-roundup) #

## The Event ##

After 11 years, the [Global Game Jam](https://globalgamejam.org) is still going strong. This year, 47,000 jammers made 9,000 games at 860 sites across 113 countries. This year, 10 new countries had jammers take part for the first time ever: Azerbaijan, Iraq, Sri Lanka, Kazakhstan, Kosovo, Kenya, the Ivory Coast, Myanmar, Namibia, and Rwanda!

This year, Global Game Jam 2019 took place from January 25th to January 27th; I was there for a majority of the time! Typically, the game jam time is based on your timezone: the theme is typically held under a public embargo until Hawaii (the last country by timezone) hits 5PM.

### Theme ###

This year's game jam theme was `[What Home Means To You](https://globalgamejam.org/news/theme-global-game-jam-2019-%E2%80%A6)`. As is customary, it was revealed at the end of the [keynote video](https://youtu.be/pUohwjq9RkA?t=836) sharing interviews with people from all over the world, speaking in their native language about what home means to them.

### Venue ###

Global Game Jam was hosted around the world;That's what the "global" was for! This year, the jammer location for RIT students was the main lab for IGM students. One welcome change was the ability to use the brand-new MAGIC center labs!

### Sponsors & Diversifiers ###

There were tons of sponsors who [showcased and paid for resources](https://globalgamejam.org/jammer-resources) as part of this event! While [Unreal Engine]() and [Unity3D]() were expected returning sponsors, there were others that always stand to support important causes that the game development community were keen to help represent.

[iThrive Games](http://ithrivegames.org/) sponsored the `Forgive and Fortify` diversifier, encouraging developers to explore forgiveness. [GitHub](https://github.com/) encouraged developers to `Use the Source`: participants were encouraged to **use one or more open source tools, game engines or libraries** in their projects. [Valve](https://www.valvesoftware.com/en/) wanted players to make a game independent of language - something that could be understood regardless of a player's language. And as always, the jam organizers encouraged all developers to make [accessible](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/winauto/microsoft-active-accessibility) work! One diversifier even encouraged participants to utilize works that were recently released into the [public domain at the start of 2019](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_in_public_domain).

### Highlights ###

- Over 50 hours of jammer footage livestreamed on [Mixer](https://mixer.com/) from all over the world.
- Rami Ismail (of [Vlambeer](https://www.vlambeer.com/) fame) announced [GameDev.World](https://gamedev.world/), a global game development event to be livestreamed and translated into eight languages.

## My Work ##

This was my first time participating in a game jam and my first time participating in a large-scale programming meetup, ever.

As part of my work with other groups, I ended up creating a **music** in addition to **programming** for my own group!

I supported fellow creators [Dillon Guscott](https://globalgamejam.org/users/dganimates) (3D Artist & Animator), [Sharlene Mendez](https://globalgamejam.org/users/smendez15) (UI Design & Art), and [Anna Karwacki](https://globalgamejam.org/users/theninjarabbit5) (Programming), in their project, [*Reggie*](https://globalgamejam.org/2019/games/reggie) - it was submitted under the `Puzzle Design Challenge` (sponsored by **Red Bull Mind Gamers** and **The Tetris Company**) and `Language-Independence` (sponsored by **Valve Software**) diversifiers. You can find the game [here](https://github.com/theninjarabbit5/GlobalGameJam2019).

During this game jam I worked with these technologies: `Blender (Open Source)`, `Maya`, `Photoshop`, `FL Studio`, `Native Instruments (Kontakt Komplete 11)`, and `Hexo (Static-Site Generator)`.

## [Letting Go](https://globalgamejam.org/2019/games/letting-go) ##

> Every home has a story. *What happens when home doesn't want to let you go?* In this game, the player must appease the spirit of their home, taking care to pack away items of sentimental value as they prepare to move out of the family home. Haunting the player, the house leaves shuffles these items around, locks doors, and attempts to persuade them to stay by showing them old memories. Do you remember? While this experience is, sadly, unfinished, you can still walk around the space we have built!

### A Look at the Team ###

Our team name was created by a collection of our initials: '[*GJACI Games*](https://rimij405.github.io/ggj19-gjaci-home/)'.

#### Environment Artists ####

[Jessica Bösherz (jb5913)](https://globalgamejam.org/users/jb5913)
[Caren Flohr (carenflohr)](https://globalgamejam.org/users/carenflohr)
> Jessica and Caren worked to put together the environment and laid out many of the assets that were made available for us to use for the game jam.

#### Animations & 3D Modelling ####

[Grant Macwilliam (gmac6422)](https://globalgamejam.org/users/gmac6422)

> Grant and Caren were in charge of creating 3D models and for polishing animations.

#### Programmer #####

[Ian Effendi (effendiian)](https://github.com/rimij405)
> I was the primary programmer for this game. I worked to get everyone's art assets into Unity's engine and troubleshooted errors that came up along the way. I also created our project's [blog](https://rimij405.github.io/ggj19-gjaci-home/) using Hexo!

#### Graphic Artist ####

[Angel Gray (angelbites)](https://globalgamejam.org/users/angelbites)

### Post-Mortem ###

#### Too-Many Hats ####

Personally, I felt that I was spread thin between so many different projects. I really want to go back and revisit the work that I started in this context. Luckily the very permissive license projects are given upon submission to the game jam mean there's an opportunity for me to go back and improve on those initial ideas. 

Game development is an iterative process; I felt there was a disconnect between my work (as a programmer) and the artwork being completed by my peers. There was a lot more time-to-polish for my work than theirs! This helped me become more comfortable with working through messy work and pushing to get a stronger level of quality.

Every project that I've taken on since then has increased in difficulty and I'm getting closer and closer to meeting what I think is a desirable level of quality.
